1. C++ RPi client
    Protocol : 
    1. Initiate bootstrapping by sending out first Interest. 
        /local-home/bootstrap/owner/<device-id>|random-number-1|HMAC(name, shared_key)
        - Signed using HMAC + shared secret (shared key)
    2. Serve self un-signed certificate
        - should we check the interest? 
            - If we don't, what bad thing will happen?  
    3. Fetch signed certificate
        - Cert name: /local-home/bootstrap/device/<device-id>
        - Owner Interest Name:
            /local-home/b..p/d..e/<id>/random-number-2/hmac(dev_id+r1+r2, shared_key)
        - Must this happen after step 2? Cannot we start this immediately afer step 1?  
            - After step 2: easier to code 
            - After step 1: may save step 2 if the owner already has the signed the certificate. (Assuming the un-signed certificate does not change)

2. Android Owner App
    Protocol: 
    1. Serve well-known bootstrapping name /local-home/bootstrap
    2. request client cert 
    3. sign and serve signed client cert
